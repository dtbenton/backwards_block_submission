Experiment 4 used a novel task to examine this question. In particular, adults were shown events in which one or two objects caused a sun to rise from within a centrally located box when they contacted it in the BB, IS, 1C, and 2C conditions. Participants were then asked to rate how likely each of four test events were to occur on a scale between 0 (certainly unlikely) and 100 (certainly likely). These test events included an A+ test event (in which individually A caused the sun to emerge), an A- test event (in which individually A failed to cause the sun to emerge), a B+ test event (in which individually B caused the sun to emerge), and a B- test event (in which individually B failed to cause the sun to emerge).
