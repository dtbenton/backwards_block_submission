Method Twenty-four college students were recruited for Experiment 2 and were given course credit for their participation. As was mentioned in Experiment 1, an a priori power analysis indicated that 16 participants would be needed to have an 80% chance of detecting a reliable difference if such a difference existed. 

Participants.
Stimuli, design, and procedure. All aspects of Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1 with one exception. In addition to asking adults to rate objects A and B on the same scale during a pre-test and post-test phase, participants were asked to provide mid-ratings of both objects. Thus, in the BB condition, participants rated objects A and B before the AB+ event, after the AB+ event, and then after the A+ event. In the IS condition, participants rated both objects before the AB+ event, after the AB+ event, and then after the A- event. In the 1C, participants rated the objects before the A+;B- events, after the A+;B- events, and then after the AB+ event. Finally, in the 2C condition, participants rated the objects before the A+++ event, after the A+++ event, and then after the A+++;B-B++ test events.

Results. Figure 2 shows the mean pre and post causal ratings of objects A and B across the four conditions. The analyses proceeded in the same order as that in Experiment 1. A preliminary analysis revealed that neither sex (male vs female) nor the order in which the conditions were presented (BB;IS;1C;2C vs IS;2C;BB;1C vs 1C;BB;2C;IS vs 2C;1C;IS;BB) interacted with any of the remaining factors. Thus, all subsequent analyses were conducted with the data collapsed over these two factors.

Control conditions. The first analysis examined whether adults engaged in 1C and 2C reasoning. Similar to the previous experiments reported here, these two conditions served as the control conditions. A mixed-effects model was thus fit to participants' causal ratings. Participants were included as a random-effect factor and phase (pre vs mid vs post), test trial (1C vs 2C), and object type (A vs B) were included as within-subjects fixed-effects factors. This analysis revealed significant main effects of Test Trial, F(1,253) = 149.843, p < .0001, Phase, F(2,253) = 62.12, p < .0001, and Object Type, F(1,253) = 768.486, p < .0001, which was mediated by a reliable Test Trial x Phase x Object Type interaction, F(2,253) = 55.06, p < .0001. Based on the reliably three-way interaction, permutation-test planned comparisons were conducted separately for the 1C and 2C conditions.

1C. Planned comparisons (with Bonferroni correction for three comparisons) for the 1C condition showed that participants provided lower pre-ratings of object A (M = 51.46; Bootstrapped 95% CI[45.76, 57.16]) than either mid-ratings of object A M = 98.13, Bootstrapped 95% CI[95.84, 100.41]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-52.78, -40.56], or post-ratings of object A (M = 99.38, Bootstrapped 95% CI[98.49, 100.26]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-53.69, -42.15]. However, participants' mid-ratings of object A did not differ reliably from their post-ratings of it, p = 1, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-3.71, 1.21]. 

In constrast, subjects provided lower mid-ratings of object B (M = 2.08, Bootstrapped 95%CI[-1.26, 5.42]) than pre-ratings of object B (M = 50.21, Bootstrapped 95% CI[44.49, 55.93]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[41.56, 54.69]. Likewise, participants provided lower post-ratings of B (M = 0.83, Bootstrapped 95%CI[-0.29, 1.96]) than pre-ratings of B, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[43.53, 55.22]. However, participants' mid-ratings of B did not differ reliably from their post-ratings of it, p = .88, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-2.31, 4.81].

2C. Planned comparisons (with Bonferroni correction for three comparisons) for the 2C condition showed that participants provided lower pre-ratings of object A  (M = 46.46, Bootstrapped 95% CI[40.94, 51.97]) than mid-ratings of A (M = 96.46, Bootstrapped 95% CI[93.03, 99.88]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-56.49, -43.5], or post-ratings of it (M = 98.33, Bootstrapped 95% CI[96.42, 100.25]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-57.71, -46.04]). However, participants mid-ratings of A did not differ reliably from their post-ratings of it, p = 1, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-5.81, 2.06].

In addition, although participants' mid-ratings of object B (M = 44.17, Bootstrapped 95% CI[38.73, 49.6]) did not differ from their pre-ratings of B (M = 48.33, Bootstrapped 95% CI[43.11, 53.55]), p = .67, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-3.34, 11.67]), participants' pre-ratings of B did differ reliably from their post-ratings of it (M = 83.58, Bootstrapped 95% CI[70.77, 96.39]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-49.04, -21.46]). Likewise, participants' mid-ratings of B differed reliably from their post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-53.3, -25.53].


IS. We next examined whether participants engaged in IS reasoning. A mixed-effects model was fit to participants' causal ratings in the IS condition. Participants were included as a random-effect factor and phase (pre vs mid vs post) and object type (A vs B) were included as within-subjects fixed-effects factors. This analysis yielded main effects for Phase, F(2,115) = 9.32, p < .001, Object Type, F(1,115) = 260.49, p < .0001, which was qualified by a Phase x Object Type interaction, F(2,115) = 189.27, p < .0001.

Follow-up (permutation) planned comparisons for object A revealed that although participants' pre-ratings of object A (M = 47.58, Bootstrapped 95% CI[42.09, 53.07]) did not differ from their mid-ratings of object A (M = 56.13, Bootstrapped 95% CI[49.42, 62.83]), p = .82, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-17.26, 0.18]), participants provided higher pre-ratings of A than post-ratings of A (M = 1.88, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-0.38, 4.13]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[39.75, 51.66], and higher mid-ratings of A than post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[47.11, 61.39].

Planned comparisons for object B revealed that although participants provided lower pre-ratings of B (M = 51.33, Bootstrapped 95% CI[44.05, 58.62]) than post-ratings of B (M = 97.08, Bootstrapped 95% CI[94.14, 100.02]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[,-53.58, -37.92] and lower mid-ratings of B (M = 62.79, Bootstrapped 95% CI[55.48, 70.1] than post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-42.12, -26.47], participants' pre- and mid-ratings of B differed only marginally, p = .11, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-21.88, -1.03]. However, because the obtained p-value (.11) exceeded the Bonferonni-corrected p-value (.008), this difference was interpreted as a non-significant one. 


BB. The final analysis examined whether adults engaged in BB reasoning. Similar to the preceding analysis, a mixed-effects model was fit to participants' causal ratings in the IS condition. Participants were included as a random-effect factor and phase (pre vs mid vs post) and object type (A vs B) were included as within-subjects fixed-effects factors. This analysis yielded main effects for Phase, F(2,115) = 17.21, p < .0001 and Object Type, F(1,115) = 21.61, p < .0001, which was qualified by a Phase x Object Type interaction, F(2,115) = 29.29, p < .0001.

Planned comparisons for object A revealed that although participants provided lower pre-ratings of A (M = 49.38, Bootstrapped 95% CI[42.33, 56.42]) than post-ratings of A (M = 98.54, Bootstrapped 95% CI[96.35, 100.73]) and lower mid-ratings of A (M = 57.5, Bootstrapped 95% CI[,47.83, 67.17]) than post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-51.02, -31.06], participants' pre- and mid-ratings of A differed only marginally, p = .19. However, because the 95% confidence interval for this latter comparison contained 0 and because the obtained p-value exceeded the Bonferroni corrected p-value of .003, the difference in participants' mean causal pre- and mid-ratings of object A was interpreted to be non-significant. 

Unlike participants' causal ratings of object A, a final set of planned comparisons  for object B revealed that participants' ratings of object B did not differ across the three rating phases, all p's > .2.


We next examined whether participants' post-ratings of B in the IS condition differed from their post-ratings of it in the BB condition. This analysis was undertaken given that previous research took this difference as evidence of BB reasoning. This analysis indicated that--consistent with previous research--participants provided higher post-ratings of object B in the IS condition (M = 97.08, Bootstrapped 95% CI[94.14, 100.02]) than post-ratings of object B in the BB condition (M = 49.17, Bootstrapped 95% CI[37.62, 60.72]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[35.92, 59.92].

Given that adults' causal ratings of object B did not change across the three rating phases, the results presented thus far suggest that they did not engage in BB reasoning. These results also indicate, albeit tentatively, that adults do not rely on a Bayesian mechanism to reason about the causal events. However, before it can be concluded definitively that adults do not rely on such a mechanism to reason about causal events, it is necessary to show that their causal ratings of objects A and B also do not conform with the predictions of the Bayesian model for the IS condition across the three rating phases. The rationale for considering this condition rather than either of the two control conditions was twofold. First, some have argued that humans engage in BB if their causal ratings of object B differ between the IS and BB conditions (e.g., Sobel et al., 2004). Second, the notion that humans use Bayesian inference to reason about causal events rests on the assumption that humans represent causal events as causal graphical models. This assumption further assumes that humans are sensitive to the pattern of conditional independencies in such models, which is an assumption that the IS condition was designed to test; that is, the IS condition has been used to examine to what extent learners represent causal events as causal graphical models and understand that in such models that some objects are independent of other objects conditioned on still other objects A (e.g., Mayrhofer & Waldmann, 2016; Park & Sloman, 2013; Rehder, 2014, 2018; Rothe, Deverett, Mayrhofer, & Kemp, 2018; Sobel & Kirkham, 2006, 2007; Sobel et al., 2004). 


Thus, to examine whether adults' responses in the IS condition confirmed the predictions of either of the three computational models, we present first the predictions of the Bayesian model for the IS condition. Note that these predictions were derived in the same manner as those for the BB condition.

As can be seen above from Table 8, the Bayesian model for the three rating phases in the IS condition predicts that adults should provide higher mid-ratings of object A and B than pre-ratings of both objects. These predictions are identical to those for the pre- and mid-rating phases in Table 1. However, unlike the predictions of the Bayesian model for the BB condition, the model predicts that post-ratings of object A should be at or near 0, whereas the model predicts that post-ratings of object B should be at or near ceiling. The reason the model makes this prediction for object A is because A is shown explicitly not to produce the effect. The reason the model makes this prediction for object B is because all models in which a link exists between object A and the effect have been eliminated based on the A- event—namely, models 0, 1, and 3. As a result, the only model that remains and that has a posterior probability of 1 is the model in which a link exists between object B and the effect—namely, model 2.
In contrast to the predictions of the Bayesian model for the IS condition, the traditional RW model predicts that participants’ ratings of object B should remain unchanged across the three rating phases. These predictions can be seen below in Table 9. This model also predicts that ratings of object A should remain unchanged across the pre- and mid-rating phases but should undergo a drop between the mid- and post-rating phases.


The predictions of the modified RW model for objects A and B are identical to those of the traditional RW model for the pre- and mid-rating phases (Table 10). However, unlike the traditional RW model or the Bayesian model, the modified RW model predicts that participants’ ratings of both objects A and B should drop to or near 0 between the mid- and post-rating phases. The reason the modified RW model makes this prediction for object A is because A is shown explicitly not to produce the effect. The reason the modified RW model predicts that object B should be rated at or near 0 is because, by being absent during the A- trial, the salience parameter associated with object B is set to -1 rather than 0 as is the case for the traditional RW model.  


Based on the preceding analyses, it is clear that participants’ pre-, mid-, and post-ratings of objects A and B in the IS condition were consistent with the predictions of the traditional RW model but not with the predictions of the Bayesian model or the modified RW model. This conclusion is based on the fact that participants’ ratings of object B remained unchanged across the three rating phases and on the fact that, although their ratings of object A remained unchanged between the pre- and mid-rating phases, their ratings of the same object dropped between the mid- and post-rating phases.



Discussion
The aim of Experiment 2 was to test the predictions of the traditional RW model, the modified RW model, and a Bayesian model. In particular, the goal was threefold. First, to determine whether, using the blicket-detector machine, adults' treatment of objects A and B across the pre-, mid-, and post-rating phases conformed to the predictions of any of the three models,. Second, to clarify the results of Experiment 1 in which it was unclear whether a Bayesian mechanism or either of the two associative mechanisms underpinned adults' ratings of objects A and B. Third, to determine whether, and to what extent, adults engage in backwards-blocking reasoning by blocking object B. The results revealed that adults' responses in the BB condition were consistent with the predictions of the traditional RW model but not with the predictions of the modified RW model or the Bayesian model. 

In conjunction with Experiment 1, the present data suggest that adults do not engage in BB reasoning; that is, do not block object B. This conclusion is based on the fact that adults' causal ratings of object B did not drop between any two rating phases. These results also indicate that a Bayesian-inference mechanism may not underpin adult causal reasoning in a blicket-detector context. This is based on the fact that adults' causal ratings of objects A and B were neither consistent with the predictions of the Bayesian model for the BB condition nor were they consistent with the predictions of the same model for the IS condition. Indeed, it will be recalled that if a Bayesian-inference mechanism underpinned adults' processing of the BB event, then their rating of object B should have increased between the pre- and mid-rating phases but then returned to baseline (i.e., the pre-rating value) between the mid- and post-rating phases. Likewise, if a Bayesian mechanism underpinned adults' processing of the IS event, then their ratings of both objects should have increased between the pre- and mid-rating phase. However, their ratings of object A should have dropped between the mid- and post-rating phases, whereas their ratings of object B should have increased between these two phases. 

This is the first series of experiments to use the blicket-detector task to show that adults do not engage in BB reasoning and to show that an associative mechanism, rather than a Bayesian mechanism, likely underpins adult causal reasoning; that is, that an associative mechanism that is perhaps based on the traditional RW model subserves human causal reasoning. This is a key finding because it has been suggested that the traditional RW model cannot account for human causal reasoning because this model fails to account for BB reasoning (e.g., Gopnik et al., 2004; Sobel & Munro, 2004; Sobel et al., 2004). Yet the present data demonstrate clearly that such a model can account for adult causal reasoning and that adults do not engage in BB reasoning. However, these findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence--cited in the Introduction--that demonstrate that whether humans engage in BB reasoning depends on the extent to which causes are viewed additively or in terms of imposed ceilings (Beckers, De Houwer, Pineno, & Miller, 2005; Lovibond et al., 2003) and that, when BB reasoning is observed, the effect tends to be smaller in magnitude (e.g., Williams, Sagness, & McPhee, 1994) or non-existent (e.g., Larkin, Aitken, & Dickinson, 1998) in relation to that for forward blocking.

An unresolved question from Experiment 2 concerns whether, and to what extent, adults will engage in BB reasoning when asked to reason about more than two objects. Although Experiment 1 has merit because it demonstrated that adults do not engage in BB reasoning when asked to reason about two objects in the blicket-detector context, it is unclear how adults will reason about more than two objects in that context and whether adults will engage in BB reasoning when reasoning about more than two objects. This is an an important concern that is worth addressing because the world consists of far more than two potential causes and because successful causal reasoning largely depends on being able to reason about multiple objects and being able to discriminate causes from noncauses. 

To date, only one study has examined this issue with 19-month-olds using the blicket detector (Sobel & Kirkham, 2006). In the study, an experimenter first placed three objects (i.e., objects A-C) on a table and then showed 19- and 24-month-old children that objects A and C together  made the detector activate when they were placed on it. Object C was then placed alone on the detector, which either caused the detector to activate (BB condition) or not (IS condition). Sobel and Kirkham reasoned that infants should be more likely to place object B on the detector than object A if they blocked or discounted A, even though object B was never placed on the machine.  The results revealed that when the 19- and 24-month-olds were given objects A and B and asked to make the machine go, only the 24-month-olds were more likely to place object A on the detector in the IS condition than in the BB condition. The 19-month-olds’ performance was at chance levels. Importantly, neither 19-month-olds nor the 24-month-olds were more likely to place object B on the machine than object A (the blocked object). Although Sobel and Kirkham interpreted these results to mean that by 24 months of age humans can engage in BB reasoning, it is unclear from these results whether the responses of the 24-month-olds were consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian model given that no such model, or its predictions, was discussed. Equally troubling is the fact that Sobel and Kirkham argued that 24-month-olds engaged in BB reasoning based on the fact that they were more likely to place object A on the machine in the IS condition than in the BB condition. As we discussed earlier, this may be not the appropriate comparison to make to assess BB reasoning given that A should elicit more responses in the IS than in the BB condition.

This means that the conclusion that a Bayesian mechanism underpinned the performance of the 24-month-olds may have been premature. Based on these issues, open questions remain concerning: (a) whether, and to what extent, learners engage in BB reasoning when asked to make causal inferences about three or more objects when BB reasoning is assessed within the same condition, (b) whether adults' treatment of three objects accords with the predictions of a Bayesian model or with either the traditional RW model or the modified RW model, and (3) whether adults' treatment of the object that is not placed on the detector (object B in Sobel and Kirkham's study) is consistent with the predictions of a Bayesian model. Experiment 3 was designed to address these issues.

Experiment 3

The goals of Experiment 3 were twofold. The first goal was to determine whether, and to what extent, adults engage in BB reasoning as evidenced by a drop in the rating of object B between any two phases. The second goal was to determine whether, and to what extent, a Bayesian or an associative mechanism underpins adult causal reasoning based on correspondence between their causal ratings and either a Bayesian model, the traditional RW model, or the modified RW model. Note that this experiment extends the ecological validity of Experiment 1 because adults' causal-reasoning abilities are assessed in the context of more objects than that shown in the first experiment.





# STUFF I SHOULD SAY AT THE END OF THE DOCUMENT #
This is the first study to compare the predictions of three prominent theories of causal reasoning within the same study and the first to examine adults' causal reasoning abilities using the blicket-detector design across three rating phases.
