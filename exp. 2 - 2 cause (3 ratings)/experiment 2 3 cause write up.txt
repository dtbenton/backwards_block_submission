Method. Twenty-four college students were recruited for Experiment 2 and were given course credit for their participation. As was mentioned in Experiment 1, an a priori power analysis indicated that 16 participants would be needed to have an 80% chance of detecting a reliable difference if such a difference existed. 

Participants.
Stimuli, design, and procedure. All aspects of Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1 with one exception. In addition to asking adults to rate objects A and B on the same scale during a pre-test and post-test phase, participants were asked to provide mid-ratings of both objects. Thus, in the BB condition, participants rated objects A and B before the AB+ event, after the AB+ event, and then after the A+ event. In the IS condition, participants rated both objects before the AB+ event, after the AB+ event, and then after the A- event. In the 1C, participants rated the objects before the A+;B- events, after the A+;B- events, and then after the AB+ event. Finally, in the 2C condition, participants rated the objects before the A+++ event, after the A+++ event, and then after the A+++;B-B++ test events.

Results. Figure 2 shows the mean pre and post causal ratings of objects A and B across the four conditions. The analyses proceeded in the same order as that in Experiment 1. A preliminary analysis revealed that neither sex (male vs female) nor the order in which the conditions were presented (BB;IS;1C;2C vs IS;2C;BB;1C vs 1C;BB;2C;IS vs 2C;1C;IS;BB) interacted with any of the remaining factors. Thus, all subsequent analyses were conducted with the data collapsed over these two factors.

Control conditions. The first analysis examined whether adults engaged in 1C and 2C reasoning. Similar to the previous experiments reported here, these two conditions served as the control conditions. A mixed-effects model was thus fit to participants' causal ratings. Participants were included as a random-effect factor and phase (pre vs mid vs post), test trial (1C vs 2C), and object type (A vs B) were included as within-subjects fixed-effects factors. This analysis revealed significant main effects of Test Trial, F(1,253) = 149.843, p < .0001, Phase, F(2,253) = 62.12, p < .0001, and Object Type, F(1,253) = 768.486, p < .0001, which was mediated by a reliable Test Trial x Phase x Object Type interaction, F(2,253) = 55.06, p < .0001. Based on the reliably three-way interaction, permutation-test planned comparisons were conducted separately for the 1C and 2C conditions.

1C. Planned comparisons (with Bonferroni correction for three comparisons) for the 1C condition showed that participants provided lower pre-ratings of object A (M = 51.46; Bootstrapped 95% CI[45.76, 57.16]) than either mid-ratings of object A M = 98.13, Bootstrapped 95% CI[95.84, 100.41]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-52.78, -40.56], or post-ratings of object A (M = 99.38, Bootstrapped 95% CI[98.49, 100.26]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-53.69, -42.15]. However, participants' mid-ratings of object A did not differ reliably from their post-ratings of it, p = 1, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-3.71, 1.21]. 

In constrast, subjects provided lower mid-ratings of object B (M = 2.08, Bootstrapped 95%CI[-1.26, 5.42]) than pre-ratings of object B (M = 50.21, Bootstrapped 95% CI[44.49, 55.93]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[41.56, 54.69]. Likewise, participants provided lower post-ratings of B (M = 0.83, Bootstrapped 95%CI[-0.29, 1.96]) than pre-ratings of B, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[43.53, 55.22]. However, participants' mid-ratings of B did not differ reliably from their post-ratings of it, p = .88, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-2.31, 4.81].

2C. Planned comparisons (with Bonferroni correction for three comparisons) for the 2C condition showed that participants provided lower pre-ratings of object A  (M = 46.46, Bootstrapped 95% CI[40.94, 51.97]) than mid-ratings of A (M = 96.46, Bootstrapped 95% CI[93.03, 99.88]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-56.49, -43.5], or post-ratings of it (M = 98.33, Bootstrapped 95% CI[96.42, 100.25]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-57.71, -46.04]). However, participants mid-ratings of A did not differ reliably from their post-ratings of it, p = 1, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-5.81, 2.06].

In addition, although participants' mid-ratings of object B (M = 44.17, Bootstrapped 95% CI[38.73, 49.6]) did not differ from their pre-ratings of B (M = 48.33, Bootstrapped 95% CI[43.11, 53.55]), p = .67, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-3.34, 11.67]), participants' pre-ratings of B did differ reliably from their post-ratings of it (M = 83.58, Bootstrapped 95% CI[70.77, 96.39]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-49.04, -21.46]). Likewise, participants' mid-ratings of B differed reliably from their post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-53.3, -25.53].


IS. We next examined whether participants engaged in IS reasoning. A mixed-effects model was fit to participants' causal ratings in the IS condition. Participants were included as a random-effect factor and phase (pre vs mid vs post) and object type (A vs B) were included as within-subjects fixed-effects factors. This analysis yielded main effects for Phase, F(2,115) = 9.32, p < .001, Object Type, F(1,115) = 260.49, p < .0001, which was qualified by a Phase x Object Type interaction, F(2,115) = 189.27, p < .0001.

Follow-up (permutation) planned comparisons for object A revealed that although participants' pre-ratings of object A (M = 47.58, Bootstrapped 95% CI[42.09, 53.07]) did not differ from their mid-ratings of object A (M = 56.13, Bootstrapped 95% CI[49.42, 62.83]), p = .82, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-17.26, 0.18]), participants provided higher pre-ratings of A than post-ratings of A (M = 1.88, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-0.38, 4.13]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[39.75, 51.66], and higher mid-ratings of A than post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[47.11, 61.39].

Planned comparisons for object B revealed that although participants provided lower pre-ratings of B (M = 51.33, Bootstrapped 95% CI[44.05, 58.62]) than post-ratings of B (M = 97.08, Bootstrapped 95% CI[94.14, 100.02]), p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[,-53.58, -37.92] and lower mid-ratings of B (M = 62.79, Bootstrapped 95% CI[55.48, 70.1] than post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-42.12, -26.47], participants' pre- and mid-ratings of B differed marginally p = .11. To determine whether this marginally significant difference was statistically meaningful, we estimated a Bayes' factor. This analysis revealed that the observed difference between participants' pre- and mid-ratings of object B was 150 times more likely under the alternative hypothesis than the null hypothesis. Using Raftery (1995) and Jeffrey's (1961) guidelines for interpreting Bayes Factors, a Bayes Factor of 150 represents, respectively, strong and decisive evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the two means differed reliably.


BB. The final analysis examined whether adults engaged in BB reasoning. Similar to the preceding analysis, a mixed-effects model was fit to participants' causal ratings in the IS condition. Participants were included as a random-effect factor and phase (pre vs mid vs post) and object type (A vs B) were included as within-subjects fixed-effects factors. This analysis yielded main effects for Phase, F(2,115) = 17.21, p < .0001 and Object Type, F(1,115) = 21.61, p < .0001, which was qualified by a Phase x Object Type interaction, F(2,115) = 29.29, p < .0001.

Planned comparisons for object A revealed that although participants provided lower pre-ratings of A (M = 49.38, Bootstrapped 95% CI[42.33, 56.42]) than post-ratings of A (M = 98.54, Bootstrapped 95% CI[96.35, 100.73]) and lower mid-ratings of A (M = 57.5, Bootstrapped 95% CI[,47.83, 67.17]) than post-ratings of it, p < .0001, Bootstrapped 95% CI[-51.02, -31.06], participants' pre- and mid-ratings of A differed only marginally, p = .19. However, because the 95% confidence interval for this latter comparison contained 0, the difference in participants' mean causal pre- and mid-ratings of object A was interpreted to be non-significant. 

A final set of planned comparisons 










# STUFF I SHOULD SAY AT THE END OF THE DOCUMENT #
This is the first study to compare the predictions of three prominent theories of causal reasoning within the same study and the first to examine adults' causal reasoning abilities using the blicket-detector design across three rating phases.
