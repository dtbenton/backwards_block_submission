Method. Twenty-four college students were recruited for Experiment 2 and were given course credit for their participation. As was mentioned in Experiment 1, an a priori power analysis indicated that 16 participants would be needed to have an 80% chance of detecting a reliable difference if such a difference existed. 

Participants.
Stimuli, design, and procedure. All aspects of Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1 with one exception. In addition to asking adults to rate objects A and B on the same scale during a pre-test and post-test phase, participants were asked to provide mid-ratings of both objects. Thus, in the BB condition, participants rated objects A and B before the AB+ event, after the AB+ event, and then after the A+ event. In the IS condition, participants rated both objects before the AB+ event, after the AB+ event, and then after the A- event. In the 1C, participants rated the objects before the A+;B- events, after the A+;B- events, and then after the AB+ event. Finally, in the 2C condition, participants rated the objects before the A+++ event, after the A+++ event, and then after the A+++;B-B++ test events.

Results. Figure 2 shows the mean pre and post causal ratings of objects A and B across the four conditions. The analyses proceeded in the same order as that in Experiment 1.





# STUFF I SHOULD SAY AT THE END OF THE DOCUMENT #
This is the first study to compare the predictions of three prominent theories of causal reasoning within the same study and the first to examine adults' causal reasoning abilities using the blicket-detector design across three rating phases.
